# Practical Information

## Weather — Late September / Early October
- **Temperature:** 20-28°C (68-82°F), gradually cooling
- **Humidity:** Decreasing from summer but still noticeable
- **Rain:** Occasional — typhoon season technically runs through October but risk drops significantly in late September
- **What to pack:** Light layers, one light rain jacket, comfortable walking shoes (you'll walk 15,000-25,000 steps/day), umbrella

## Money & Payments
- **Currency:** Japanese Yen (¥). Bring some GBP/USD to exchange at the airport, or withdraw from 7-Eleven/Japan Post ATMs (Visa/Mastercard accepted)
- **Cash is important:** Many smaller restaurants, temples, and rural spots are cash-only. Carry ¥10,000-20,000 cash at all times
- **IC cards (Suica/PASMO):** Use for trains, buses, and konbini purchases. Set up Mobile Suica on iPhone for maximum convenience
- **Credit cards:** Accepted at hotels, department stores, larger restaurants, and chain shops

## Connectivity
- **eSIM** (recommended): Ubigi or Airalo — buy and activate before departure, ~¥2,000-5,000 for 14 days
- **Pocket WiFi** (alternative): Rent online, pick up at airport. More reliable in rural areas
- **Free WiFi:** Available at stations, konbini, and some cafes but unreliable

## Getting Around
- **Trains are king.** Tokyo Metro, JR lines, private railways cover everything
- **Google Maps** works perfectly for transit directions in Japan — trust it for routes and times
- **SmartEX app** — book Shinkansen tickets in English, use QR code at gates
- **Taxis:** Metered, honest, doors open automatically. Use as backup when transit stops (~midnight)
- **Walking:** Many neighborhoods are best explored on foot. Wear comfortable shoes

## Etiquette Basics
- **Bowing:** A slight bow is appreciated when greeting, thanking, or saying goodbye
- **Shoes off:** Remove shoes when entering ryokans, some restaurants, temples, and homes. Look for a genkan (entryway) and slippers
- **Quiet on trains:** Keep voices low, phones on silent, no phone calls
- **Tipping:** Do NOT tip. It's not expected and can be confusing
- **Queueing:** Japanese queue culture is strong. Line up neatly
- **Chopstick rules:** Don't stick chopsticks upright in rice (funeral association), don't pass food chopstick-to-chopstick

## Onsen Etiquette (for Hakone)
1. Wash thoroughly at the shower stations BEFORE entering the bath
2. No swimwear in the onsen — you go in naked
3. Tie long hair up so it doesn't touch the water
4. Small towel can go on your head but NOT in the water
5. Be quiet and relaxed — onsen is for contemplation
6. Tattoo policy: Yama no Chaya is typically fine with tattoos in private baths. Confirm when booking if relevant
