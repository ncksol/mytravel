# Tokyo Hotel Research — Akasaka Area

## Requirements

| Constraint | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Dates | Sep 19-25, 2026 (6 nights) |
| Area | Akasaka, Tokyo |
| Budget target | £100/night (max £150/night) |
| Guests | 2 people |
| Priority ratings | German & Dutch tourist reviews |
| Booking advantage | Genius Level 3 on Booking.com (10-20% off) |

> ⚠️ **Silver Week 2026** (Sep 19-23) overlaps with our dates — one of Japan's busiest domestic travel periods. Hotel prices are 50-70% higher than standard rates during this week. Genius L3 discounts partially offset this but don't fully compensate.

## ✅ Selected: Hotel Monterey Akasaka

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Booking.com | **8.5/10** |
| Agoda | 8.6/10 |
| Actual booked price | **£137/night** (Silver Week rate, free cancellation) |
| Total (6 nights) | **£822** |
| Station | 5 min walk to Akasaka-mitsuke |
| Room size | ~18m² (standard Tokyo) |
| Breakfast | Available (¥3,520 pp, Japanese + Western) |

**Why we chose it:** European-inspired décor (London townhouse theme) — German and Dutch reviewers specifically praise the atmosphere as comfortable and familiar. Excellent soundproofing. Clean rooms with consistent quality. Staff praised for multilingual service. Well-established chain.

**German/Dutch review highlights:**
- *"Perfect location to explore Tokyo... room very clean, staff welcoming"* — Germany
- *"Rooms not large by European standards but comfortable... breakfast with both Japanese and Western options was great"* — Netherlands

**Note on pricing:** Standard rates are £64-88/night but Silver Week pushed the actual price to £137/night — a ~70% premium over normal rates. This exceeded the initial £100/night target but remains within the £150 hard max.

## Other Candidates Researched

### Hotel Asia Center of Japan — Runner-up

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Booking.com | **8.6/10** |
| Trip.com | 9.3/10 |
| Standard price | $78-140/night (~£62-112) |
| Estimated Silver Week + Genius | ~£70-120/night |
| Station | Near Aoyama-Itchome/Nogizaka (~10 min walk to Akasaka-mitsuke) |
| Room types | Compact Twin (Annex) or Superior Twin (Main Building) |

**Pros:** Highest-rated of all candidates across platforms. Excellent breakfast included in some rates. Multilingual staff. Very clean, quiet location.

**Cons:** Slightly further from Akasaka-mitsuke — closer to Aoyama-Itchome station (still excellent metro access, just different lines). Wide price range — the cheaper "Annex" rooms are small, the main building rooms are nicer but pricier. Upper end during Silver Week could exceed £100.

**Why not selected:** Location slightly less convenient than Monterey, and price variability makes it harder to predict final cost.

### Hotel Hillarys Akasaka — Budget Pick

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Booking.com | **8.2/10** (~3,000 reviews) |
| Standard price | ~¥9,570+/night (~£48-56) |
| Estimated Silver Week + Genius | ~£55-75/night |
| Station | Very close to Akasaka station |
| Standout features | **Public bath/onsen**, rooftop terrace, free coffee/tea |

**Pros:** By far the cheapest option — potentially half the budget, freeing up money for better meals and experiences. Has an actual public bath (unusual for this price point). Modern, relatively new. Free coffee bar in lobby.

**Cons:** Room size is very compact even by Tokyo standards. Fewer reviews from European travelers specifically. Some guests note tight spaces with luggage — could be an issue for 6 nights.

**Why not selected:** Rooms too compact for a 6-night stay with two people and luggage. Good backup option if Monterey becomes unavailable or too expensive.

### the b Akasaka — Mid-range

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Booking.com | 7.9/10 |
| Agoda | 8.2/10 |
| Standard price | $92-117/night (~£74-94) |
| Estimated Silver Week + Genius | ~£85-110/night |
| Station | Walk to Akasaka-mitsuke |

**Pros:** Solid mid-range option. Modern, clean. Good location near the station.

**Cons:** Lower Booking.com score (7.9) than the top picks. Some reviews mention a steep hill to reach the hotel, which could be annoying daily. At a similar price point, Hotel Monterey is better rated and better located.

**Why not selected:** Lower ratings and the hill access issue made Monterey a clearly better choice at a similar price.

## Rejected Hotels

| Hotel | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| MIMARU Tokyo Akasaka | Apartment-style, £200+/night — well above budget |
| Hotel Mystays Premier Akasaka | Not available for our dates |
| Mitsui Garden Jingugaien Premier | $170-260/night — well above budget even with Genius |
| Centurion Hotel Grand Akasaka | 7.4/10 on Booking.com — rating too low |
| APA Hotel Akasaka Mitsuke | Rooms notoriously tiny — not suitable for 6 nights |

---

## Key Takeaway

Silver Week pricing is brutal — expect 50-70% premiums over standard rates for Tokyo hotels during Sep 19-23. The Genius Level 3 discount (10-20% off) helps but doesn't fully compensate. Book as early as possible with free cancellation and keep checking for better rates as the date approaches.
