## Transit Summary

| HND → Akasaka | Keikyu + Metro | ~50 min | ~¥700 |
| Tokyo → Hakone | Romancecar (Shinjuku) | 85 min | ¥2,470 |

## JR Pass Verdict: ❌ Skip It

Individual tickets total ~¥30,750 per person for all intercity legs. A 7-day JR Pass costs ¥50,000 and wouldn't cover Tokyo→Hakone (Odakyu, not JR). Individual tickets save ~¥19,000 per person.
