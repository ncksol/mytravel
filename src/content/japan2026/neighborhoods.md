## 🏮 Yanaka — Old Tokyo Time Capsule

**Station:** Nippori (JR Yamanote) or Sendagi (Chiyoda Line)

One of the few Tokyo neighborhoods that survived WWII bombing. Old wooden houses, narrow lanes, temple-dotted streets, and cats everywhere. This is "shitamachi" (old downtown) — feels like stepping back 60 years.

### Walking Route (~2 hours)

1. Start at **Nippori Station** west exit
2. Walk through **Yanaka Cemetery** — atmospheric, beautiful, many famous people buried here. Cherry trees line the paths
3. Turn into the narrow residential lanes — spot old wooden houses and tiny shrines
4. Emerge at **Yanaka Ginza** shopping street — the highlight. Small local shops, street food, handmade goods
5. Try **menchi-katsu** (deep-fried meat patties) from a street vendor
6. Walk south through quiet temple streets toward **Nezu Shrine**
7. End at **Nezu Shrine** — one of Tokyo's oldest and most beautiful. Famous for its tunnel of vermillion torii gates (a smaller, uncrowded version of Fushimi Inari)

### Where to Eat

- **Yanaka Beer Hall** — craft beer in a renovated house
- **Kayaba Coffee** — renovated 1916 building, famous egg sandwich and "Russian coffee" (with whipped cream)
- **Himitsu-do** — famous kakigori (shaved ice). Expect a line, worth the wait
- **Nezu no Taiyaki** — fish-shaped waffle with bean paste

### Best Paired With

Ueno (walk from Ueno through Yanaka to Nippori, 30 min). The Yanaka-Nezu-Sendagi walking route is one of Tokyo's best half-day strolls.

6. Check out the small live houses and theater posters — the neighborhood has a strong performing arts scene

### Where to Eat

- **Bear Pond Espresso** — legendary coffee, eccentric owner. No photos of the espresso machine allowed
- **Shirube** — tiny izakaya with great atmosphere

## 🎵 Koenji — Punk & Counterculture

**Station:** Koenji (JR Chuo/Sobu Line — 7 min from Shinjuku)

4. Explore the **used record stores** — deep crates, obscure Japanese pressings
5. Walk the back streets — tiny bars, independent galleries, hand-painted signs
6. Check evening listings at **live houses** — intimate venues with ¥1,500-3,000 cover including a drink

## 🎌 Kagurazaka — French-Japanese Fusion District

**Station:** Kagurazaka (Tozai Line) or Iidabashi (JR, multiple subway lines)

Called "the little Paris of Tokyo" due to a French school and cultural institute nearby. But it's also one of Tokyo's old geisha districts — narrow cobblestone alleys ("kakurenbo yokocho" / "hide-and-seek alleys") hide traditional ryotei restaurants. A unique blend of French and Japanese culture.

### Walking Route (~1.5 hours)

1. Start at the bottom of **Kagurazaka slope** (from Iidabashi Station)
2. Walk up the main slope — shops, bakeries, restaurants on both sides
3. Turn into the **stone-paved side alleys** branching off — this is where the magic is. Get deliberately lost
4. Find **Akagi Shrine** — renovated by architect Kengo Kuma. Modern design meets ancient Shinto
5. Browse French bakeries mixed with Japanese craft shops
6. Explore the **ryotei alleys** — traditional high-end restaurants behind noren curtains

### Where to Eat

- **French bistros and bakeries** — Paul, Le Bretagne (crepes/galettes)
- **Traditional ryotei** along the hidden alleys (reservations needed for dinner)
- **Canal Cafe** — canal-side Italian/cafe with boat rentals. Lovely on a warm evening

### Best Paired With

Combine with Shinjuku day or Imperial Palace area. Works as a lunch destination between sights.
