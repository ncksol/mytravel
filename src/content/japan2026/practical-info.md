# Practical Information

## Weather — Late September / Early October
- **Temperature:** 20-28°C (68-82°F), gradually cooling
- **Humidity:** Decreasing from summer but still noticeable
- **Rain:** Occasional — typhoon season technically runs through October but risk drops significantly in late September
- **What to pack:** Light layers, one light rain jacket, comfortable walking shoes (you'll walk 15,000-25,000 steps/day), umbrella

## Money & Payments
- **Currency:** Japanese Yen (¥). Bring some GBP/USD to exchange at the airport, or withdraw from 7-Eleven/Japan Post ATMs (Visa/Mastercard accepted)
- **Cash is important:** Many smaller restaurants, temples, and rural spots are cash-only. Carry ¥10,000-20,000 cash at all times
- **IC cards (Suica/PASMO):** Use for trains, buses, and konbini purchases. Set up Mobile Suica on iPhone for maximum convenience
- **Credit cards:** Accepted at hotels, department stores, larger restaurants, and chain shops

## Connectivity
- **eSIM** (recommended): Ubigi or Airalo — buy and activate before departure, ~¥2,000-5,000 for 14 days
- **Pocket WiFi** (alternative): Rent online, pick up at airport. More reliable in rural areas
- **Free WiFi:** Available at stations, konbini, and some cafes but unreliable

## Getting Around
- **Trains are king.** Tokyo Metro, JR lines, private railways cover everything
- **Google Maps** works perfectly for transit directions in Japan — trust it for routes and times
- **SmartEX app** — book Shinkansen tickets in English, use QR code at gates
- **Taxis:** Metered, honest, doors open automatically. Use as backup when transit stops (~midnight)
- **Walking:** Many neighborhoods are best explored on foot. Wear comfortable shoes

## Etiquette Basics
- **Bowing:** A slight bow is appreciated when greeting, thanking, or saying goodbye
- **Shoes off:** Remove shoes when entering ryokans, some restaurants, temples, and homes. Look for a genkan (entryway) and slippers
- **Quiet on trains:** Keep voices low, phones on silent, no phone calls
- **Tipping:** Do NOT tip. It's not expected and can be confusing
- **Queueing:** Japanese queue culture is strong. Line up neatly
- **Chopstick rules:** Don't stick chopsticks upright in rice (funeral association), don't pass food chopstick-to-chopstick

## Onsen Etiquette (for Hakone)
1. Wash thoroughly at the shower stations BEFORE entering the bath
2. No swimwear in the onsen — you go in naked
3. Tie long hair up so it doesn't touch the water
4. Small towel can go on your head but NOT in the water
5. Be quiet and relaxed — onsen is for contemplation
6. Tattoo policy: Yama no Chaya is typically fine with tattoos in private baths. Confirm when booking if relevant

## 🗑️ Trash Disposal — No Public Bins!

**There are almost no public trash bins in Japan.** This surprises every first-timer.

**What to do:**
- Carry a small plastic bag in your daypack for your trash
- Convenience stores (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart) have trash bins — use them when you buy something there
- Vending machines have recycling bins attached (bottles/cans only)
- Train stations sometimes have bins near the gates
- Your hotel room will have a trash bin

**Recycling matters:** When you do find bins, they're separated into:
- Burnable (paper, food waste)
- PET bottles (plastic drink bottles)
- Cans / Glass bottles
- Non-burnable (plastics)

## 📱 Essential Apps

| App | Purpose | Essential? |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| **Google Maps** | Navigation, train routes, walking directions. Works brilliantly in Japan with real-time transit data | YES |

## 👟 Shoe Removal Protocol

Remove shoes when:
- **Entering any home** (including Airbnb)
- **Entering ryokan rooms** (change to indoor slippers at the entrance)
- **Entering some temples** (look for shoe racks, raised floors, or signs)
- **Entering some restaurants** (especially tatami-seated ones)
- **Entering fitting rooms** at some stores
- **Entering some onsen changing rooms**

**The general rule:** If the floor level changes (steps up), shoes come off. Look for a **genkan** (entry area with a level change) and a shoe rack.

**⚠️ Toilet slippers:** Many ryokans and some restaurants have separate slippers for the toilet room. Wear them IN the toilet, remove them when you leave. Forgetting to switch back is the classic tourist mistake.

**Tip:** Wear slip-on shoes — you'll be removing them constantly at temples and restaurants. Laces become annoying very quickly.

## 🚂 Additional Train Etiquette

Beyond keeping quiet:
- **No eating on local trains** (commuter trains, subway). Eating IS acceptable on Shinkansen — buy an ekiben (station bento)
- **Queue in marked lines** on the platform. People line up precisely at door markers
- **Let passengers exit first** before boarding
- **Backpacks:** Take off large backpacks and hold them low or place on luggage rack
- **Priority seats** (marked in different color at end of each car): yield to elderly, pregnant, disabled, small children

## 🎌 Cultural Tips Beyond Etiquette

- **No eating while walking** (except at markets and festivals). Find a spot to stand and eat
- **"Itadakimasu"** — say this before eating at a restaurant. It means "I humbly receive." Staff genuinely appreciate it
- **"Sumimasen"** is the single most useful word. Use it to get attention, apologize, thank, or excuse yourself
- **Umbrella etiquette:** When entering a store/restaurant, look for the umbrella stand or plastic umbrella bags at the entrance
- **Escalator standing:** Stand on the LEFT in Tokyo, LEFT in Kyoto/Osaka (despite the common myth about Osaka being different, it varies)
- **Konbini payment:** Place money on the tray, not directly in the cashier's hand
